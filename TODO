TODO
====

General
-------

* should I rename the module ReservationSystem to Main?
    * then I would need to rename the file as well, Main.hs looks ugly
* facilitate changeability for Trains and Stations?
    * provide second xml for configuring trains?
* correct error handling when reading non-existant xml
    * output on stderr and stdout sometimes is interspersed in output terminal
* clean up case chaos in mainloop
* ui for inputting data for each menu option
* assure that there is enough free place before issuing reservation
* query existing reservations - yay


Features
--------

* Facilitate Testability with HUnit?
    * HUnit is ready (testmain) - but not sure yet how to test monadic functions where suppressing of output from putStr would be desirable

TODO
====

General
-------

* should I rename the module ReservationSystem to Main?
    * then I would need to rename the file as well, Main.hs looks ugly
* facilitate changeability for Trains and Stations?
    * provide second xml for configuring trains?
* correct error handling when reading non-existant xml
    * output on stderr and stdout sometimes is interspersed in output terminal
* clean up case chaos in mainloop
* assure that there is enough free place before issuing reservation
* query existing reservations - yay
* Zippers are great, but we could also look into Data.IntMap
* if static trains or stations is changed combined with the usage of a deprecated xml, a checkConsitency function could come in handy
* Task Description unclear: "Mindestanzahl der freien und maximale Anzahl der durch Einzelreservierung bzw. Gruppenreservierung belegten Plätze pro Zug und Waggon"
    * should the free places be calculated for all trains and separated by cars OR should a train and car be input OR both and more?


Features
--------

* Facilitate Testability with HUnit?
    * HUnit is ready (testmain) - but not sure yet how to test monadic functions where suppressing of output from putStr would be desirable
